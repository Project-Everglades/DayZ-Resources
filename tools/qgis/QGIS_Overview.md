# QGIS Overview

QGIS (Quantum Geographic Information System) is a free and open-source GIS application used for viewing, editing, and analyzing geographic data. It is particularly valuable in mapping and terrain generation, making it ideal for game development projects that require accurate map data.

## Why Use QGIS?

QGIS allows for extensive control over geographic data, enabling users to manipulate data layers, create maps, and process terrain for modding and game design. It is essential for creating realistic and highly detailed maps in game environments.
